# Majorana 1: Microsoft’s new quantum chip

Microsoft has unveiled Majorana 1, a quantum chip that promises a significant leap forward in the development of large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computing. The company claims that this breakthrough could accelerate the arrival of practical quantum computers from decades to just a few years - a stark contrast to the words of NVIDIA's CEO earlier this year.

### What is Majorana 1?

Majorana 1 is Microsoft's first Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) powered by a topological core, an entirely new approach to quantum computing. The chip is built using a novel material known as a ‘topoconductor,’ which enables the creation of stable and scalable topological qubits. Unlike traditional quantum computing approaches that rely on highly fragile qubits, Microsoft's design is intended to be less prone to errors and more resistant to environmental noise.

Microsoft claims that Majorana 1 has the potential to scale up to one million qubits on a single chip, a milestone that would bring quantum computing significantly closer to commercial reality. This is a stark contrast to current quantum processors, which typically operate with fewer than 100 qubits and struggle with error correction.

Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, emphasised the significance of this development, stating: "Majorana 1 represents a fundamental shift in quantum computing. With this breakthrough, we are not just making incremental progress; we are laying the groundwork for a future where quantum computing becomes a practical reality in the near term."

### The magic behind Majorana 1

At the heart of the chip is a superconducting nanowire made from indium arsenide and aluminium. This material combination enables the formation of Majorana zero modes, a theoretical particle that was first proposed in the 1930s but has been notoriously difficult to demonstrate experimentally.

Microsoft's topoconductors allow the creation and manipulation of Majorana zero modes, forming the basis for topological qubits. These qubits are distinct from traditional superconducting qubits (such as those used by Google and IBM) because they are inherently protected from certain types of errors, making them more stable and reliable.

Unlike standard quantum computing methods, which require thousands of physical qubits to create a single logical qubit, topological qubits naturally resist errors, reducing the overhead for quantum error correction. Microsoft has also developed a novel readout system that reportedly achieves 99% accuracy in qubit state detection.

Chetan Nayak, Corporate Vice President of Quantum Hardware at Microsoft, explained: "Majorana 1 is built on nearly two decades of research and development. By leveraging topoconductors, we have developed a quantum chip that is not only scalable but also inherently robust against errors—an essential step toward building a fault-tolerant quantum computer."

### How does it compare to its rivals at Google and IBM?

Microsoft’s announcement comes at a time when Google and IBM are also making significant advancements in quantum computing. In late 2024, Google unveiled its "Willow" quantum chip, which demonstrated quantum supremacy by solving complex calculations in minutes that would take classical supercomputers thousands of years. IBM, meanwhile, has projected that large-scale quantum computing will be commercially viable by 2033.

Microsoft, however, believes it can achieve fault-tolerant quantum computing much sooner, stating that its approach could bring quantum breakthroughs "in years, not decades." If successful, this would place Microsoft ahead in the race to develop a scalable quantum computer.

### Applications of Majorana 1

Microsoft envisions Majorana 1 unlocking solutions for some of the world's most challenging problems, including:

- Drug discovery – Accelerating the identification of new medicines by simulating molecular interactions with unprecedented accuracy
- AI optimisation – Enhancing artificial intelligence models by enabling massive parallel computation beyond classical limits
- Climate science – Helping researchers find ways to break down microplastics in the ocean and develop self-healing materials for infrastructure
- Financial modelling – Optimising complex economic simulations for risk assessment and market predictions

Paul Stevenson, Professor of Physics at the University of Surrey, offered a cautious perspective, stating: "While Majorana 1 is an exciting advancement, the path to scalable and practical quantum computing remains complex. Independent verification and further experimental validation will be critical to confirming Microsoft's claims."

### Microsoft’s collaboration with DARPA and the road ahead

Microsoft has partnered with DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) as part of its "Utility-Scale Quantum Computing" initiative. The company has committed to building a fault-tolerant quantum prototype in the coming years, further solidifying its role as a leader in quantum research.

According to Chetan Nayak, Microsoft’s Corporate Vice President of Quantum Hardware, the company has been working on this technology for nearly two decades. The research leading to Majorana 1 has been peer-reviewed and published in Nature, giving credibility to Microsoft’s claims.

DARPA selected Microsoft and PsiQuantum to progress to the final phase of its Underexplored Systems for Utility-Scale Quantum Computing (US2QC) program. This initiative, part of DARPA's broader Quantum Benchmarking Initiative (QBI), aims to evaluate and validate innovative approaches to building utility-scale quantum computers.

As part of the US2QC program's Validation and Co-Design phase, Microsoft will work closely with DARPA's evaluation team to refine and validate their quantum computing design. This collaboration involves rigorous testing of components and hardware, as well as assessments of system-level performance capabilities of major prototypes. The goal is to demonstrate the feasibility of constructing a utility-scale quantum computer that can address real-world challenges.

### Scepticisms &amp; final thoughts

Despite the excitement surrounding Majorana 1, some experts remain cautious. Majorana zero modes have been a topic of scientific controversy, and Microsoft previously faced scrutiny when it retracted a 2018 paper claiming experimental evidence of these particles.

While Microsoft's approach appears promising and its inclusion in Nature a good sign, independent verification of its claims will be critical. Some physicists argue that additional experimental validation is needed to confirm that Majorana 1 truly contains Majorana zero modes and is not producing false signals from other quasiparticles.

Microsoft’s Majorana 1 quantum chip is one of the most ambitious attempts yet to bridge the gap between theoretical quantum physics and practical quantum computing. If the company’s claims hold up to further scrutiny, this could be the beginning of a new era in computing – one where quantum processors solve problems far beyond the reach of classical machines.

With its roadmap leading to fault-tolerant, million-qubit quantum systems, Microsoft is staking its claim in the future of computing. Whether it can deliver on this vision remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the quantum race is heating up, and Microsoft has just made a bold move to take the lead.
